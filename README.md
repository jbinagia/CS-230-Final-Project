# CS-230-Final-Project
Final project for Stanford CS 230 - Deep learning (Autumn 2019). Our goal is to apply [boltzmann generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01729) to new molecular systems. A description of our progress on this project can be found in [our milestone writeup](https://github.com/jbinagia/CS-230-Final-Project/blob/master/CS_230_Milestone.pdf).

## Installation and Usage
To view our analysis, one can perform the following steps. 
- Activate a virtual environment and install the required libraries, e.g.:
```shell
virtualenv -p python .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Open up one of the Jupyter notebooks located in the [notebooks](https://github.com/jbinagia/CS-230-Final-Project/tree/master/notebooks) folder.
